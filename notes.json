When you open this note, I’ll be just 7 days away from being home, ready to hold you close and make up for every moment we missed. I’m so excited to see your beautiful smile again and to love on you like never before. Counting down the days until we’re together again, Estef you mean the world to me!

Love,

Michael💖 "
